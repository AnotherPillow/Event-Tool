# Event Tool
Sugar's Event Tool for SDV event scripting.


## What is Sugar's Event Tool?

Event tool is a simple Python tool to make scripting SDV Mod events easier and faster! 

It's not a full-on program, so it won't do much of the work for you, since event scripting takes a lot of creativity.
However, it will (hopefully!) make event scripting more easier to read and more user-friendly.

Also - emphasis on *simple*. This tool was initially made for personal use, so it's more catered to which commands I use most often.
It does not include the entire command list, but it does let you add custom commands that isn't specifically supported by this tool, such as `advancedMove` and the like.

## How do I use this?

Check out the [detailed documentation](https://github.com/sugarsbt/Event-Tool/wiki) on how to set up and use this tool!
